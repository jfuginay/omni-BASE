4. Check console logs in Xcode
```

## 📊 Performance Tips

### Battery Life
- Use "While Using App" location permission (not "Always")
- Lower screen brightness
- Close other apps
- Enable Low Power Mode for extended ops

### Network Usage
- TAK connection uses minimal data (~10-50 KB/min)
- Works on both WiFi and cellular
- Use WiFi when available for best reliability

### GPS Accuracy
- Best: Clear sky, outdoor, stationary
- Good: Outdoor, moving
- Fair: Near windows, slow movement
- Poor: Indoor, dense urban
