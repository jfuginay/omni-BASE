# Contributing to OmniTAK

Welcome! We're thrilled you want to contribute. This guide will walk you through making your first contribution, even if you've never done it before.

## 🎯 Quick Start: I Just Want to Fix a Typo!

If you just want to fix a typo or make a small change:

1. **Click the "Edit" button** on GitHub (looks like a pencil ✏️)
2. **Make your change** in the browser
3. **Scroll down and click "Propose changes"**
4. **Click "Create pull request"**

Done! We'll review it and merge it. Easy!

## 🚀 Making Your First Real Contribution

### Step 1: Get a Copy of the Code

**Option A: Using GitHub Desktop (Easiest)**

1. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Install and sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "Clone Repository from the Internet..."
4. Search for `omni-BASE` and click "Clone"
5. Choose where to save it on your computer

**Option B: Using Command Line**

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/engindearing/omni-BASE.git
cd omni-BASE
```

### Step 2: Make Your Change

Find the file you want to change and edit it with any text editor:
- **TextEdit** (Mac)
- **Notepad** (Windows)
- **VS Code** (recommended, free download)

Save your changes!

### Step 3: Test Your Changes (Optional but Nice)

If you changed code:
```bash
# Test it still builds
./scripts/build_ios.sh simulator debug
```

If you just changed documentation (like README.md), you're good to go!

### Step 4: Submit Your Changes

**Option A: Using GitHub Desktop**

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. You'll see your changes listed
3. In the bottom left, type a short description like "Fix typo in README"
4. Click "Commit to main"
5. Click "Push origin"
6. Click "Create Pull Request"
7. Click "Create pull request" on the web page that opens

**Option B: Using Command Line**

```bash
# Save your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix typo in README"  # Describe what you changed
git push

# Then go to GitHub and click "Create Pull Request"
```

### Step 5: Wait for Review

We'll review your pull request within a few days and either:
- ✅ Merge it (yay!)
- 💬 Ask questions or request small changes
- ❌ Explain if we can't merge it (rare!)

## ✅ Before You Submit

Please check:

- [ ] **Did you test it?** (if code changed)
- [ ] **Did you explain what you changed?** (in commit message)
- [ ] **Is your code formatted nicely?** (readable, has comments)
- [ ] **Did you update documentation?** (if you added features)

Don't worry if you're not perfect - we'll help you improve it!

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

Found a bug? Help us fix it!

1. **Go to Issues** on GitHub
2. **Click "New Issue"**
3. **Tell us:**
   - What you expected to happen
   - What actually happened
   - Steps to reproduce it
   - Screenshots if helpful
4. **Click "Submit new issue"**

### Good Bug Report Example

```
Title: App crashes when switching servers

Description:
- I was on "Taky Server"
- I tapped the status bar to open server list
- I tapped "Switch" on "My Custom Server"
- App immediately crashed

Expected: Should switch to new server smoothly

Environment:
- iPhone 15 Pro
- iOS 17.5.1
- OmniTAK version 1.0.0

Screenshot: [attached]
```

## 💡 Suggesting Features

Have an idea? We'd love to hear it!

1. **Go to Issues** on GitHub
2. **Click "New Issue"**
3. **Select "Feature Request"** (if available)
4. **Tell us:**
   - What feature you want
   - Why it would be useful
   - How you imagine it working
5. **Click "Submit new issue"**

### Good Feature Request Example

```
Title: Add dark mode toggle

Description:
I'd love to have a dark mode option for night operations.

Currently the map is always in satellite view with a light UI,
which is bright at night.

Suggested implementation:
- Add a toggle in settings for "Dark Mode"
- When enabled, use dark colors for all UI elements
- Keep map in satellite view (already dark)
- Use yellow accents (already used) for visibility

This would be useful for:
- Night operations
- Battery saving
- Eye strain reduction

Happy to help test this if implemented!
```

## 📚 Documentation Contributions

Documentation is code too! Help us make our docs better:

- **README.md** - Main project description
- **docs/PLUGIN_*.md** - Plugin system docs
- **plugin-template/README.md** - Plugin template docs
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - This file!

### Making Docs Better

Good documentation:
- ✅ Uses simple language
- ✅ Has examples
- ✅ Has screenshots (for UI things)
- ✅ Explains *why*, not just *how*
- ✅ Assumes the reader is smart but new

Bad documentation:
- ❌ Uses lots of jargon
- ❌ Says "it's obvious" or "simply do X"
- ❌ Skips steps
- ❌ Has no examples
- ❌ Is condescending
